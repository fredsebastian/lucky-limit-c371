	<p>
		I am a biomedical engineer and researcher, recently completing my PhD in soft tissue biomechanics. 
		My work focuses on the intersection of medical technology, robotics, and data science — including soft robotic devices 
		for neurorehabilitation, early-stage clinical trial design, and computational modeling of disease trends.
	</p>

	<p>
		Before my doctoral work, I contributed to a soft robotics project at the National University of Singapore that evolved 
		into a commercial product for hand rehabilitation. I’ve also supported early-stage FDA IDE trials in industry, and hold 
		experience in both academic and translational research settings.
	</p>

	<p>
		In my free time, I explore creativity through cooking, baking, writing, drawing, and food photography. I see these 
		practices as deeply connected to my work — they require experimentation, attention to detail, and a love of process.
	</p>

	<p>
		This site brings together the technical and creative sides of my journey. You can find highlights from my projects, 
		view my publications, or just get a sense of the ideas that shape my work, both in and out of the lab.
