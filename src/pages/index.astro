	<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I am a biomedical engineer and researcher, recently completing my Ph.D. in soft tissue biomechanics at Northeastern University. 
  My work lies at the intersection of medical technology, robotics, and data science â€” spanning soft-tissue biomechanics, medical device design and augmentation, 
  soft robotic systems for neurorehabilitation, early-stage clinical trial design, and computational modeling of disease trends.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  My passion for bioengineering began during my undergraduate and masterâ€™s studies at Arizona State University. While there, I studied abroad twice and discovered a deep appreciation for translational experiences. 
  Courses like <em>Sociology of Medicine and Health</em> and <em>Global Health Studies</em> helped shape my interest in wearable technologies â€” with a focus on accessibility and impact. 
  I contributed to a soft robotics project at the National University of Singapore that evolved into a commercial hand rehabilitation device for stroke patients. 
  At Dartmouth College, I explored the role of big data in breathomics for tuberculosis detection, which further deepened my interest in data science. 
  During my doctoral work, I also served as a systems engineer at Third Pole Therapeutics, contributing to early-stage clinical trials for an FDA-regulated nitric oxide delivery system.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  My Ph.D. research centered on developing diagnostic and prognostic tools for angle-closure glaucoma â€” with a particular focus on the disproportionate impact the disease has on women. 
  I leveraged skills from my Data Analytics in Engineering certificate to extract insights from metadata analysis, ex vivo animal testing, and in vivo clinical studies, supported by computational modeling techniques.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Outside of research, Iâ€™m passionate about building community and fostering collaboration. I also explore creativity through cooking, baking, writing, drawing, and food photography â€” 
  pursuits that mirror my work in their shared emphasis on experimentation, precision, and process.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  This site brings together the technical and creative sides of my journey. Here, youâ€™ll find highlights from my projects, my publications, and the ideas that shape my work â€” both inside and outside the lab.
