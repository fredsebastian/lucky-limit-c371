        <p>
          Poetry has long served as a quiet counterpart to my technical work — a space to reflect, explore language, and process experience through rhythm and metaphor.
        </p>
        <p>
          I’m particularly inspired by the formal experimentation of <strong>e. e. cummings</strong> and the introspective clarity of <strong>Sylvia Plath</strong>. Their work reminds me that structure and emotion can coexist powerfully.
        </p>
        <p>
          Below are selected poems from recent years. These pieces reflect themes of identity, memory, place, and the shifting relationships we hold with ourselves and the world.

<em>If</em>

If freckles were lovely, and day was night,
And measles were nice and a lie warn’t a lie,
Life would be delight,—
But things couldn’t go right
For in such a sad plight
I wouldn’t be I.

If earth was heaven and now was hence,
And past was present, and false was true,
There might be some sense
But I’d be in suspense
For on such a pretense
You wouldn’t be you.

If fear was plucky, and globes were square,
And dirt was cleanly and tears were glee
Things would seem fair,—
Yet they’d all despair,
For if here was there
We wouldn’t be we.

<em>Kindness</em>

Kindness glides about my house.
Dame Kindness, she is so nice!
The blue and red jewels of her rings smoke
In the windows, the mirrors
Are filling with smiles.

What is so real as the cry of a child?
A rabbit's cry may be wilder
But it has no soul.
Sugar can cure everything, so Kindness says.
Sugar is a necessary fluid,

Its crystals a little poultice.
O kindness, kindness
Sweetly picking up pieces!
My Japanese silks, desperate butterflies,
May be pinned any minute, anesthetized.

And here you come, with a cup of tea
Wreathed in steam.
The blood jet is poetry,
There is no stopping it.
You hand me two children, two roses.
